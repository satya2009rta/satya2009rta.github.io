<a style="text-decoration:none; font-size:40px; color:#636363">Hallo!</a> <br><br>
I am a PhD (Computer Science) student at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/" style="text-decoration:none">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a>. I am working in <a href="https://cossy.mpi-sws.org/" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit">Control Software Systems group</a>, advised by <a href="https://wp.mpi-sws.org/akschmuck/" style="text-decoration:none">Anne-Kathrin Schmuck</a>.

My research work is mainly focused on the formal verification and synthesis of cyber-physical systems. I am especially interested in logic, reactive synthesis, and games on graphs.

I completed my Masters in Computer Science and Bachelors in Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in" style="text-decoration:none">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>. Prior to that, I grew up in Odisha and I did my schooling from <a href="https://shraddha.org/" style="text-decoration:none">Rtapalli Vidyapitha</a>.
