## Research Internships
* <strong><abbr title="This is also my Master's thesis project. In this project, we worked on a problem of synthesizing controllers that are optimal with respect to
a quality criterion based on Robust Linear Temporal Logic. In perticular, we introduced a strategy that adaptively changes its moves when the opponent make some bad choices.">
  Adaptive Strategies for rLTL Games</abbr></strong><br>
  <small> Daniel Neider & Martin Zimmermann &bull; Max Planck Institute for Software Systems &bull; University of Liverpool &bull; <em class="date"> July - Dec 2020 </em></small>
* <strong><abbr title="In this summer internship, we studied various classes of visibly pushdown automata in the perspective of minimization and canonization. We also worked on the relationship of these approaches with canonization algorithms for non-classical tree automata such as stepwise tree automata.">
